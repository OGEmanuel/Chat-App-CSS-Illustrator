## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project has been the most tedious work I've done. It opened my eyes to a whole lot of possibilities with flexbox, the flexibiity and the complexity that comes with it. I got stuck at some point, where I was trying to flex-end some pictures. After about 6-8hrs of debugging, I found a way out. This challenge is indeed a challenge, lol. The media queries gave me a little headache, as I could not position the after pseudo class for the mobile views. Otherwise, everything else is in very good state. This is one great challenge I'd recommend anyone to try, most especially those who want to put their CSS skills to test, most especially media queries.

### Continued development

Like I mentioned above, I still have to tidy up my skills on media queries in other to be able to deliver on the big stage
